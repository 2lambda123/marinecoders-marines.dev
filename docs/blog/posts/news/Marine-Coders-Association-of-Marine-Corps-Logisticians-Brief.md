# Marine Coders Association of Marine Corps Logisticians Brief

Check out Marine Coders presentation to the [Association of Marine Corps Logisticians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XybGruUNc7s)!  This was a great opportunity to share the Marine Coders vision with the Association of Marine Corps Logisticians. Good overall discussion focusing on the importance of software and how to enable a "software engineering micro-capability" at commands to improve mission with software tools, training, DevSecOps environments, and data!
