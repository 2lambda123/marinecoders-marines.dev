# Getting Started in USMC Software Development

This guide does not cover software development basics and assumes a rudimentary understanding of software development. If you need help learning the basics, please visit our learning section for self guided [zero to hero courses](learn.md).

## Where to store software

### Concept

A software repository is a location, local or networked, that can store source code for software. As a general rule, we store our open source software in our Marine Coders github group, and our CUI repositories on web.git.mil.

Some platform as a Service (PaaS) offer software repositories as part of the services provided. A few examples would include the [Tactical Assault Kit (TAK)](https://tak.gov/) which offers repository access in addition to team.

### Available Respositories

| Repository | Owner | Data Classification  | Description |
|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| [Github Group - Marine Coders](https://github.com/marinecoders/)  | Marine Coders | Unclassified | Open source and unclassified projects  |
| [web.git.mil](https://web.git.mil)  | DISA HaCC | Controlled Unclassified Information | General Purpose repository, available to all DoD. [MIU Group](https://web.git.mil/USG/DOD/USMC/MFR/MIU)  |
| [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/repos/) | General Services Administration | [DoD CC SRG IL2](https://cloud.gov/docs/overview/portfolio-analysis/) | $9300/month for IL2 per one system for prod |
 
### Prescriptive Guidance

Version Control: As a general rule, use [git](https://git-scm.com/) as a distributed version control. 

> Editor's note (Collin Chew): I have never come across anything other than git as a version control engine in the last 10 years in the DoD or in industry.
