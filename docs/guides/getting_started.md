# Getting Started in USMC Software Development

This guide does not cover software development basics and assumes a rudimentary understanding of software development. If you need help learning the basics, please visit our learning section for self guided [zero to hero courses](learn.md).

## Where to "store" software

### Concept

A software repository is a location, local or networked, that can store source code for software. As a general rule, we store our open source software in our Marine Coders github group, and our CUI repositories on web.git.mil.

Some platform as a Service (PaaS) offer software repositories as part of the services provided. A few examples would include the [Tactical Assault Kit (TAK)](https://tak.gov/) which offers repository access in addition to team. 

Categories:

- General Use
- Platform Specific
- Application Specific
- Organization Specific

### Available Repoositories

The below list is not exhaustive. These below repositories are intended for general use that is not nested under a specific program of record or acqusition program. There are many repositories that are hosted by system integrators and mission partners that are not on this list. 

| Repository | Owner | Data Classification  | Requirement | Description |
|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|

### Prescriptive Guidance for software 

Version Control: As a general rule, use [git](https://git-scm.com/) as a distributed version control. 

> Editor's note (Collin Chew): I have never come across anything other than git as a version control engine in the last 10 years in the DoD or in industry.
