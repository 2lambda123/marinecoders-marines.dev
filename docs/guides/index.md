<!--- USMC Developer Guide --->
# Intro to the USMC Developer Guide Series

These guides are intended to accelerate the understanding of domain specific USMC software development. These guide is intended to be vendor neutral to the best of our ability. They are open source and welcome contributions - it is as good as we make it collectively. Each section has a concept, prescriptive guidance, walkthroughs, and additional references.

#### Basics

These guide do not cover software development basics and assumes a rudimentary understanding of software development. If you need help learning the basics, please visit our learning section for self guided [zero to hero courses](learn.md).

#### Contributions

We welcome contributions. There are two primary ways to contribute, pull requests and raising issues. If you are a subject matter expert, pull requests are the most helpful. If you're not an expert, raising an issue is still helpful and brings it to our attention sooner! All of our issues/PRs are adjudicated on the public repository as a manner of keeping discourse public. As a reminder, none of our full time jobs are this website so we are working through the issues as best as we can.
